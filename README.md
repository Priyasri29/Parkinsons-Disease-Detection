# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

Parkinson's Disease is a progressive neurogenerative condition resulting from the death of the dopamine containing cells of the substania nigra(which plays an important role in movement). Symptoms include "frozen" facial features, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), akinesia(impairment of voluntary movement), tremor and voice impairment. Typically , by the time the disease is diagonised, 60% of nigrostriatal neurons will be degenerated, and 80% of striatal dopamine will deplete. Parkinson's disease is second most prevalant neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's, affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. 

There is no single test which can be administered for diagnosis. Instead doctors must perform a careful clinical analysis of the patient's medical history. Unfortunately this method of diagnosis is highly inaccurate. A study from the national institute of neurological Disorders finds that early diagnosis(having symptoms for 5 years or less) is only 53% accurate. this is not much better than random guess, but an early diagnosis is critical to effective treatment.

This Project addresses the drawbacks/shortcomings through a machine learning approach to accurately diagnose Parkinson's using a dataset of various speech features ( A Non-Invasive technique) from the Oxford university. Why Speech features ? Speech is very predictive and characteristic of Parkinson's disease. Almost every parkinsons's patient experience severe vocal degradation(inability to produce sustained phonations, tremor,hoarseness), so it makes sense to use the voice to diagnose the disease.
